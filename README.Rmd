> Never again (probably). fplR to the rescue...

An R package that provides a compendium of tools for working with [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) (FPL) data in R. 

## Installation

Get the development version from GitHub (CRAN submission should follow after commencement of the 2017/18 FPL season). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ewenme/fplR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

### Data Analysis / Usage Examples in Vignettes

There are a couple of vignettes, introducing the packages principles and functionality, as well as some data analysis use cases. 

For a complete list of vignettes run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes(package = "fplR")
```

### Player data examples

#### Get summary data on all players in the current FPL season

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fplR)

# player data for current FPL season (note: this will update to 2017/18 season once underway):
players()
?players

```

#### Get detailed data (gameweek-level) on a player in the current FPL season (still 2016/17, currently)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fplR)

# Gameweek-level data for Alexis Sanchez in the current FPL season (note: this will update to 2017/18 season once underway):
playerDetailed(player_id = 12)
?playerDetailed

```

### User data examples

#### Get data on a user's player picks for a gameweek in the current FPL season

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(fplR)

# player data for current FPL season (note: this will update to 2017/18 season once underway):
userPicks(user_id = 123, gameweek = 10)
